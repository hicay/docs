## How to Use Speaker Identification

### 1. Identifying and Labeling Speakers
- TranscribeTube automatically labels speakers with generic names, such as **Speaker 0**, **Speaker 1**, etc., based on the audio analysis.
- To change a speaker label, click on the **speaker name** next to the transcript text.
- A dropdown menu will appear, allowing you to select an existing speaker label or **add a new speaker** name.

### 2. Adding New Speakers
- If there are additional speakers, you can create new labels by selecting **"Add New"** from the dropdown.
- Enter a custom name for the new speaker, such as "Interviewer" or "John Doe," to make the transcript more descriptive and specific.

### 3. Editing and Saving Speaker Labels
- After assigning speaker labels, review the transcript to ensure each section is correctly attributed to the appropriate speaker.
- Click **Save Changes** to apply these edits, ensuring that your speaker labels are retained in the final transcript.

### 4. Downloading the Transcript with Speaker Labels
- Once your transcript is edited with speaker labels, click on **Download Transcription**.
- The downloaded file will include the customized speaker names, making it easy to identify who said what in the transcript.
